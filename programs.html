											<td>Are there any fees for the program?</td>
											<td>No. The program is absolutely free.</td>

											<td>Who can apply?</td>
											<td>Anyone who is a current high school student (grades 9 through 12) or older can apply. 
												We also encourage non-traditional students, like those who did not attend college, are serving in the military, or wish to re-enter the
												educational system, to apply. International students are welcome.</td>

												have never pursued scientific research in the past. 
												We will provide all applicants with no mentor match the opportunity
												to learn asynchronously with us.

								<h2><br/>We bridge the opportunity gap in
									scientific research. <br/> </h2>
								<p> Traditional research training has relied on in-person labwork mentored by 
								staff in the research laboratory, limiting the number of students that can be trained in basic
								scientific research skills. 
									
								</p>
							</section>
							<section>
								<h3><br/> <br/> We enable more students to have access to research training by: <br/> <br/> </h3>
								<ol>
									<li>relying on open-science models of freely available scientific literature, textbooks, encyclopedias, and datasets; </li>
									<li>setting no required qualifications from  basic research skills, and  </li>
									<li>crowdsourcing mentors with experience in science.</li>
								</ol>

							<h2>Curriculum</h2>
							<h3>We recognize that many students are in need of a more flexible scientific curriculum.</h3>
							<p> We pair students with mentors who will individually advise them on a flexible schedule (akin to private tutors) and provide resources to pursue project-based learning in scientific research. For budding scientists, this involves familiarizing themselves with science. For well-rooted scientists, this involves pursuing an independent research project using open-source materials. </p>
						</section>
						
						
						<hr/>
						<section>
							<h2>Staff</h2>
							<h3>We are powered by a volunteer force that is dedicated to furthering diversity in science. </h3>
							<p>As the students gain valuable scientific experiences, staff gain experience in leading a scientific project as a small-scale primary investigator and a scientific mentor. In the cases where students submit their summer projects to a student journal, these mentors serve as primary investigators for these papers. We employ diverse mentors with keenness to their passion for fostering diversity. We support volunteers and students alike in their professional development, which enables our program to flourish.</p>
						</section>

						<hr/>
						<section>
							<h2>Resources</h2>
							<h3>With the open science movement, science can be done anywhere and at any time.</h3>
							Unlike the traditional scientific research model, where subscription-based journals and expensive tools barred entry to science, laypeople are now freely able to engage in scientific research. We leverage this fact and use these tools for education.</p>
						</section>

						<hr/>
						<section>
						<h2>Organization</h2>
						<p>We are a collection of volunteers who are impassioned to bring science research to the people. 
							We, as an organization, are a 501(c)3 charitable organization incorporated in the state of California. 
							In the coming future, we aim to to grow the program across more disciplines and serve more individuals across the world.
