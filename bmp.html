					<h2> The Biology Mentorship Program (BMP) is a 6-week summer program that provides high school students the opportunity to develop areas of research interest within neuroscience. </h2>

                    <p style="color:rgba(255,255,255,.7)">
                    This free and accessible program is a valuable tool for aspiring biologists (like you!) to explore science with resources that have been, and will always be, available. These include open-source softwares, open-access papers, volunteer mentors, among others. Students will use these resources to pursue an independent project that will culminate in a presentation and a write-up by the end of the summer. 
                    </p>

                    <section id="requirements">

                    <p style="color:rgba(255,255,255,.7)">Students participating in BMP are expected to dedicate around 10-20 hours per week on the program, but this requirement is flexible. In addition, students must be available for most of the program dates: June 20th - July 28th. There are absolutely no other requirements. We currently expect to be able to accommodate all interested students. However, if spots do become limited, preference will be given to:<br/>

                        <li>Students underrepresented in science or higher education;<br/><br/></li>

                        <li>Older students who have never had the opportunity to participate in formal scientific projects; and <br/><br/></li>

                    <p style="color:rgba(255,255,255,.7)">This program will have <u>one weekly journal club</u> and <u>one weekly lecture</u> for all students, which will be recorded. Every week, during journal clubs, groups of students will present a research paper that they find intriguing to a group of students participating in BMP. This presentation will be created with the help of your mentor(s). In addition, there will be weekly check-ins with your mentor on the progress of your project. <br/><br/>
                    
                    During the last week of the program, each student will present their individual project in a <u>10 to 15-minute presentation</u>. In conjunction with the presentation, each student will submit--and keep--a <u>project paper</u> that can be used as a research supplement in college or other applications. Some students in the past have submitted their papers into student journals, which is great! However, keep in mind that the central focus of this program is first and foremost on enabling students to think carefully, deeply, and playfully as a scientist. <br/><br/>
