                        <p>We are growing with aims to reach underserved populations 
                            across the country. With this in mind, we are seeking passionate mentors with research experience to support STEM 
                            education and equity in scientific training. Mentors provide the horsepower of this organization. 
                            There are multiple fronts for which we are currently accepting applications. 
                            We would be delighted to have you take part in various leadership and mentorship opportunities.</p>

                                <h3>5-10 hours per week in the summer</h3>
                                <p>The mentor serves as direct contact for students to develop an individualized summer project. This is a very fulfilling role: 
                                    with two to three students to mentor in the summer (or more, depending on your availability), you will directly navigate 
                                    mentorship for young, budding scientists! In addition, you will be able to develop a summer curriculum. While we have 
                                    previously developed a program-wide curriculum, you will be able to provide feedback and edits to continually improve our teaching.

                                <p>You will be responsible for leading this diversity initiative. Your role will include searching for, contacting, and understanding the community surrounding these schools to provide our program as a resource. To that end, you will work closely with these communities to identify ways that the NMP can best support these needs. To support this endeavor, you will develop the resources and infrastructure, such as a program website. In addition, you will be providing support for the development of Sci-MI into a nonprofit.
