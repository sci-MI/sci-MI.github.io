                        <p>We are growing with aims to reach underserved populations 
                            across the country. With this in mind, we are seeking passionate mentors with research experience to support STEM 
                            education and equity in scientific training. Mentors provide the horsepower of this organization. 
                            There are multiple fronts for which we are currently accepting applications. 
                            We would be delighted to have you take part in various leadership and mentorship opportunities.</p>

                                <p>The mentor serves as direct contact for students to develop an individualized summer project. This is a very fulfilling role: 
                                    with two to three students to mentor in the summer (or more, depending on your availability), you will directly navigate 
                                    mentorship for young, budding scientists! In addition, you will be able to develop a summer curriculum. While we have 
                                    previously developed a program-wide curriculum, you will be able to provide feedback and edits to continually improve our teaching.
