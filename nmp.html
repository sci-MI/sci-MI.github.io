                    <p>
                    The Neuroscience Mentorship Program (NMP) is a summer program that provides high school students the opportunity to develop areas of interest within neuroscience. This free and accessible program aims to serve as a valuable tool for aspiring neuroscientists (like you!) to explore the world of neuroscience with resources that have been, and will always be, available to them. Such resources include open-source softwares, open-access papers, willing mentors, and more. Students will use these resources to pursue an independent project that will culminate in a presentation and a project paper by the end of the summer. This is a great program for students who have always been interested in learning more about neuroscience or scientific research but have not had the opportunity or ability to pursue it. <br/><br/>
                    This free and flexible program enables barrier-free participation in science without penalty for metrics like low GPA, socioeconomic status, disability, current skill sets, and many others that arbitrarily keep individuals out of scientific disciplines.
                    </p>

                    <h1 class="major">Requirements</h1>
                    High school students participating in NMP must be able to dedicate approximately 20 hours per week on the program, but this requirement is flexible. There are absolutely no other requirements. We currently expect to be able to accommodate all interested students. However, if spots do become limited, preference will be given to:<br/><br/>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>Students underrepresented in neuroscience or higher education;</li>

                        <li>Upperclassmen who have never had the opportunity to participate in formal scientific projects; and</li>
                        
                        <li>Students who are not taking part in another summer internship or are unable to participate in enriching summer activities (e.g. those who have to take care of siblings or family members for an extended period of time, have summer work commitments that bars one from taking part in career-oriented activities, among others). </li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h1 class="major">Program Structure</h1>
                    This program will have one weekly journal club and one weekly group meeting for all students. Every week, during journal clubs, students will present a research paper that is intriguing to them to the group of students participating in SMP-IEN. This presentation will be created with the help of your mentor(s). In addition, there will be weekly check-ins with your mentor on the progress of your project. <br/><br/>
                    
                    During the last week of the program, each student will present their individual project in a 10 to 15-minute presentation. In conjunction with the presentation, each student will submit--and keep--a project paper that can be used as a research supplement in college or other applications. <br/><br/>

                    Please note: While research output is an excellent way to prepare for college and beyond, the central focus of this program is first and foremost on enabling students to think carefully, deeply, and playfully as a scientist. <br/><br/>
