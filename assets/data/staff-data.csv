Broghan,O'Hearn,mentor,"Hi everyone! My name is Broghan (she/her) and I’m a rising senior at Wellesley College studying cellular, molecular, and cognitive Neuroscience! I hope to attend med-school after doing one or two years of research post-college.
At Wellesley, I am part of the Bauer lab studying C. elegans and glutamate transporters! This summer I am working as a Clinical Operations intern at a CNS specialized biopharmaceutical company in Cambridge, which I’m super excited about.
I spend most of my free-time being an avid Taylor Swift fan, fostering kittens, going to the beach, kayaking, and am trying to get into yoga! I grew up moving countries every two years and am extremely grateful for everything I got to experience throughout my childhood. Some other things about me are that I’m the oldest of five kids and have an absolutely precious great dane. I am passionate about making science more accessible and am looking forward to working with my mentees and peers this summer. (edited) ",,broghan
Alexander,Truong,mentor,"I'm a junior at UT Dallas studying Neuroscience entering my (hopefully) final year of undergrad. I've just recently transferred in Fall 21 from studying for a PharmD up in Boston, and this was my first year majoring in neuro. Regardless, I'm excited to learn all I can and I have plans to one day attain an MD, practice surgery and conduct research on neuropsychiatric disorders. Right now, I've recently started working in a lab studying nanotechnology-based techniques for brain biotransport and infectious disease diagnosis.

Zander,Hary,mentor,"Hey everyone! I'm Zander Hary (he, him) a junior at Brown concentrating in Neuroscience. I'm currently working in the Jaworski Lab at Brown studying embryonic spinal cord development with most of my work focusing on cell biology (so I'm not too well versed with computational neuro, but I'm well equipped in biological research methods!). I'm looking forward to discovering exactly what I want to do as a career, as I am stuck considering between a PhD program or MD program (perhaps both?) so as I look forward to inspiring the next generation of scientists, I hope that I can also discover a fulfilling career path of my own. Something important about my background is that I am a transfer student, from Boston College to Brown, which has indirectly given me a unique perspective on the differences in pedagogical methods between universities. I value academic freedom and exploration, which I hope to pass on to my mentees! A fun fact about me is I drew a white-board-dragon using dry erase markers around my dorm room as a method of destressing, it currently covers 3 of my 4 walls. The dragon's name is Reggie.",,zander
Michal,Lipinski,mentor,"My name is Michal Lipinski (he/him) and I am currently a postdoc at Harvard Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology department, and Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT. I am truly passionate about addressing serious mental health disorders using cell biology, and I am lucky enough to be able to study it for living. In the lab I use stem cell based models, specifically cortical organoids, to study lithium-resistant bipolar disorder. Happy to tell you more if someone’s interested! I am a biotechnologist (BS, MS), turned neuroscientist (MS, PhD) with… 11 years of lab experience (terrifying), and roughly 5 years fully leading my own project. Throughout that time I mentored a couple of RA’s and undergrads. I am joining the Sci-MI team because I really like the interaction with the students and mentoring, but right now I do not have an opportunity to do so. In the past I taught basic computer science to elder folks, run science fair stands and even gave a pop-science lecture to a crowd of 100+ non-scientific audience. In the most recent years I lead a team of volunteers to provide a COVID-time relief to non-english speakers around Somerville and Medford in MA as part of Mutual Aid network called MAMAS. One thing that might come up as useful is that apart from English I am fluent in Polish and Spanish. In the free time I recharge my batteries with my needy kitty, tend to a fairly large collection of tropical plants (Hoyas ftw) and play soccer. Good to meet you all and excited to be part of this awesome initiative!",,michal

Lauren,Sun,mentor,"Hello everyone! My name is Lauren Sun (she/her). I am a recent graduate of Wellesley College and majored in neuroscience and anthropology. I spent the past 3 years conducting research at Northwestern University in tissue regeneration and wound healing. I specifically studied the mechanisms of hydration on wound healing and the role of the Nax channel. Though I loved my time studying wound healing, I am also very passionate about neuroscience (hence the major) and obstetrics and gynecology. As an anthropology major, I studied systemic and structural inequalities more closely and developed a desire to find ways to treat these issues in our society.
